# P2P Car Rental Marketplace

Peer to peer (P2P) asset sharing is a very economically efficient model in which idle assets are utilized to generate revenue. With the increase in costs for purchasing and maintaining a vehicle including insurance and taxes that are imposed on the vehicle it is becoming more and more burdensome on middle to lower class families to use private vehicles for personal use. Most private vehicles that are purchased remain unused. This creates an idle asset which keeps on incurring losses for the owner. 

This is where our program comes in to help both the vehicle owner and vehicle user who want to use vehicles for a short span of time without having to worry about all the legal procedures and fees that come along with owning a vehicle. Our program works as a Peer to Peer Car Rental Marketplace where car owners can list their vehicles for rent and people can rent listed vehicles. We particularly want to help tourists that come to visit a country or city that wish to rent a vehicle for travelling for a short period of time, likely 1 to 7 days.
